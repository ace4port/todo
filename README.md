## What is this and who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

It is a simple app to be used by anyone. I am front end(React developer) and this is a showcase project I've built in my spare time. It's a very simple application that I plan to include more features to.

I personally used the previous version to prioritize my work for months to keep track of stuff. I realized it could be more and thus, I want to convert it to an Eisenhower Matrix for prioritizing tasks based on importance and urgency. There are many _todo_ projects out there but I couldnt find one I needed.

## Features

- Written in modern React, only functional components with hooks
- Simple local React state management, without redux, mobx, or similar
- Scalable, and easy to understand project structure
- Persists data within browser

## Planned Features

- Authentication
- Database
- Backend
- Chrome Extension
- PWA

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- `cd todo`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- App should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`

## What's missing?

### Proper authentication system üîê

Currently all todos are stored in localstorage of browser. This is a topic I am yet to decide to implement.
This would surely enable multi device login, synchronizaion of notes on various devices but nobody needs to remember/keep track of yet another set of username/password.

### Chrome Extension ‚õë

Do I make a chrome extension of this?

### PWA üì±

Or do I convert it into a pwa and publish on play store?

### Accessibility ‚ôø

Not all components have properly defined [aria attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), visual focus indicators etc.

### Unit/Integration tests üß™
